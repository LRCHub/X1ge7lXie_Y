Pixelated kisses got me goin' insane
Replicate this moment from a million miles away
Waiting for the signal, baby, never make a sound
If you never hear from me, all the satellites
are down
Yeah, they're all fuckin' down
Falling through the atmosphere right now
Baby, are you really down?
Baby, are you really down?
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
